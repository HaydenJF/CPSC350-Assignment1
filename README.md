ERRORS:

The only error I have in the program is with the 1000 lines method. There is nothing technically wrong with it but if I try to read a file with 1000 lines the ifstream cuts off when it is around 400 lines. I don't know why this happens. My guess is that a big enough file surpasses ifstreams set size and because I don't know how to increase the size that an ifstream can read I cannot fix it. I hope this isn't a big deal and I hope you enjoy my project :)
